# NiceBreakers â›„

> The best thing to happen since ice-breakers!

## Concept ðŸ§ 

A visitor can join a lobby (created by a moderator) in which everyone plays low-stress games in an attempt to get the highest score... by learning as much about everyone else as possible. Enter: _NiceBreakers_. ðŸ˜Ž

Ice-breakers tend to nudge people out of their comfort zones. The right balance between challenging, yet fun, and casual-ness can divert the intimidation surrounding ice-breakers. _NiceBreakers_ is a project that strives to achieve this balance by practicing simple design patterns and leveraging powerful collaborative technologies. Learn more about your newest colleagues with _NiceBreakers_, the best thing since ice-breakers!

## Technology âš¡

This Next.js application is powered by WebSockets to allow people to create and join lobbies.
